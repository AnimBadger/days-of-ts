## Objects, Arrays, Enums and Tuples

-- Arrays
    using the union way of declaring 
    let myArray: (string | number)[]
    multiple data types can be added, declaring without type default to any
    an array with type string can not add other data types

-- Tuples
    strict with position of data types and length
    let myTuple: (string, number) = ['Sterling', 34] 

-- Objects
    Objects can be Arrays
    can be declared by. let myObject: object or let myObject = {}
    when using {} types are fixed. myObject = {
        'data': 'stephen',
        'age': 34
    }
    cant do this myObject.age = 'asf'

    using `type` will let you declare the data type and properties you want for an object
    can use interface and works the same but does not require `=` when declaring
    `?` to make optional

-- Enums
